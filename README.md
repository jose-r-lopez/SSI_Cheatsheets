# SSI_Cheatsheets

In the course *Seguridad de Sistemas Informáticos* (SSI, Computer Systems Security) from the *Escuela de Ingeniería Informática* of the University of Oviedo (https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/) we make extensive usage of cheatsheets for various tools. I have decided to share them to enable others to take advantage of these materials if they want. Please, be sure to also check my related repo *SSI_Materials* (https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/SSI_Materials) that contains how to create training labs to test these tools.

Each tool cheatsheet is provided in its own PDF file and will be uploaded periodically, so be sure to check the repository frequently.  

Currently I offer cheatsheets for these tools:

* **cewl**: Custom wordlist generation tool from a web page
* **crunch**: Tool that generates wordlists from a character set, to create custom password dictionaries
* **dirb**: HTTP directory and content discovery tool
* **dnsenum**: Multithreaded perl script to enumerate DNS information of a domain
 
 More to come!
 
 Happy security training! :D
