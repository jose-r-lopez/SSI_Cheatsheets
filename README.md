# Extra materials of our *Computer Systems Security* Course 

I am the coordinator of an undergraduate security course in a small university in the North of Spain (University of Oviedo, Asturias). It is taught in the *School of Computer Engineering* (EII), *University of Oviedo*, Spain (https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/) . We intend to introduce our future software engineers in the world of cybersecurity covering the major topics of this discipline. Unfortunately, the time is very limited and being an undergraduate course makes it impossible to go deep into any of the topics. To counter that, and for those that want to specialize in this amazing discipline, we provide extra materials that complement or reinforce the course teachings. These are not evaluable, but allows our students to better understand the concepts and also helps them to pursue a cybersecurity careers. As all these materials are extracted from free and public sources, we thought that it will be useful for many people to compile them in an structured and classified way (following the course syllabus) so anybody, not only our students, may be able to access them and contribute to the hacking community the best we can. We also incorporate some extra materials developed by our team in the mix, such as the tool cheatsheets and the Secure Coding Checklist. This repo is exactly the same one we will refer to our actual students that want to know more about some of the topics.

**All materials have been moved and classified into this repo wiki (https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/SSI_Extra_Materials/wiki)**. 

**NOTE**: Please be patient, this repo will be updated frequently over time as we process or discover new materials.

 Happy security training! :D
