# Extra materials for my Security Courses

I am the coordinator of one undergraduate and three graduate security courses in a small university in the North of Spain (University of Oviedo, Asturias). They are taught in the *School of Computer Engineering* (EII), *University of Oviedo*, Spain (https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/). 

With these courses we intend to introduce our future software engineers in the world of cybersecurity, covering the major topics of this discipline. Unfortunately, the lecture time is very limited, and that makes it impossible to go deep into multiple topics. To counter that, and for those that want to specialize in this amazing discipline, we provide extra materials that complement or reinforce the teachings of those courses. 

These are not evaluable, but allows our students to better understand the concepts, and also helps them to pursue a cybersecurity career. As all these materials are extracted from free and public sources, we thought that it will be useful for many people to compile them in an structured and classified way (following the undergraduate course syllabus) so anybody, not only our students, may be able to access them and contribute to the hacking community the best we can. 

We also incorporate some extra materials developed by me in the mix, such as the tool cheatsheets and the _Secure Coding Checklist_.

**All materials have been moved and classified into this repo wiki (https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/SSI_Extra_Materials/wiki)**. 

**NOTE**: Please be patient, this repo will be updated frequently over time as we process or discover new materials.

 Happy security training! :D
