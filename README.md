# SSI_Cheatsheets

In the course *Seguridad de Sistemas Informáticos* (SSI, Computer Systems Security) from the *Escuela de Ingeniería Informática* of the University of Oviedo (https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/) we make extensive usage of cheatsheets for various tools. I have decided to share them to enable others to take advantage of these materials if they want. Please, be sure to also check my related repo *SSI_Materials* (https://github.com/jose-r-lopez/SSI_Materials) that contains how to create training labs to test these tools.

Each tool cheatsheet is provided in its own PDF file. The initial set of 33 cheatsheets (course 2020-2021) have been uploaded. Next course I will plan to create some more if needed, so this repo may get updated over time.  

Currently I offer 33 cheatsheets for these tools:

* **cewl**: Custom wordlist generation tool from a web page
* **crunch**: Tool that generates wordlists from a character set, to create custom password dictionaries
* **dirb**: HTTP directory and content discovery tool
* **dnsenum**: Multithreaded perl script to enumerate DNS information of a domain
* **dotdotpwn**: Automated scanning tool for File Inclusion vulnerabilities in URL paths
* **eyewitness**: Tool used to capture screenshots from a list of URLs
* **gpg**: Multipurpose GPL cipher/hash/pubkey software
* **gtfobins1**: Executables to enable privilege scalation in Linux systems (Part 1). GTFOBins is a collaborative project created by Emilio Pinna and Andrea Cardaci (https://gtfobins.github.io/). You should check the project site to know the specifics of each executable. The entries in the cheatsheet point to them.
* **gtfobins2**: Executables to enable privilege scalation in Linux systems (Part 2). GTFOBins is a collaborative project created by Emilio Pinna and Andrea Cardaci (https://gtfobins.github.io/). You should check the project site to know the specifics of each executable. The entries in the cheatsheet point to them.
* **hydra**: Offline password cracking tool
* **john**: Offline password cracking tool
* **knockpy**: Enumerates subdomains on a target domain through a wordlist
* **lolbas**: Executables to enable privilege scalation on Windows system. Please check the original project and the specifics of each executable in https://lolbas-project.github.io/. The entries in the cheatsheet point to them.
* **msfvenom**: A Metasploit standalone payload generator. 
* **netcat**: Multipurpose ("Swiss army knife") TCP/IP tool 
* **netdiscover**: An active / passive network scanner
* **nikto**: Lightweight web server vulnerability scanner
* **Nmap**: The reference swiss army knife in security. Cheatsheet are divided in 5 parts:
  * **nmap - recon**: Nmap part 1A: Basic recon
  * **nmap - advanced recon**: Nmap part 1B: Advanced recon
  * **nmap - enumeration**: Nmap part 2: Target Enumeration
  * **nmap - exploiting**: Nmap part 3: Target exploiting
  * **nmap - other options**: Nmap part 4: Other Nmap options
* **searchploit**: Public exploit offline browsing tool
* **snmpwalk**: Tool to discover flaws when using the SNMP protocol
* **steghide**: Classic steganography tool
* **sublist3r**: Python tool to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT
* **theHarvester**: OSINT tool for websites
* **tmux**: Console enhancer and multi-pane support tool
* **twint**: An Advanced Twitter Scraping Tool
* **ufw**: Tool to ease Ubuntu firewall management
* **wapiti**: Website vulnerability scanner
* **wpscan**: A vulnerability scanner for WordPress websites
* **zmap**: Fast internet-wide scanner
 
 I have also added the previously unreleased "Secure Coding Checklist Template" that was aimed to enable my students to have a quick reference of common security checks that should be done to their code, enabling automatic calculation of implemented security controls similar to those that can be done with the *CIS Controls*. **This is by no means a methodology** (it was adapted from a rather old document from OWASP, the *OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide v2.0*, https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_SCP_Quick_Reference_Guide_v2.pdf), but enables the students to perform an adequate code review in a short time, turning those applications that use this checklist substantially more secure just by making sure several of these controls are correctly implemented in their code. Just remember that my students are beginning to learn security practices, so I thought it will be nice for them to have a centralized checklist of things to check that also enable some metrics so they can easily show their work. 
 
 I should have released this on the course 2020-2021, but the COVID-19 problems made me delay its termination. Now I have finished it and it will be released on the 2021-2022 course, and also for all of you that find it useful!
 
 Happy security training! :D
